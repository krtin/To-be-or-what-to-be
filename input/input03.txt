President Obama arrived in Seoul, South Korea, Friday to news that North Korea may ---- counting down to a nuclear weapons test. Such moves out of Pyongyang ---- no surprise and are typical for the North's behavior, Obama told reporters while in Tokyo, his previous stop on his Asia trip. The President said he ---- prepared to deliver a firm response, if a test ---- conducted during his visit. North Korea's heightened activity at its nuclear test site ---- already known. But now the final step needed for an underground detonation has ---- taken, a South Korean government official said Thursday. The North has closed off the entrance to the tunnel at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, the official said. That gives Pyongyang 11 days to either detonate a nuclear device or cancel the test. It would ---- the North's fourth test of a nuclear weapon. Both Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-hye want to display a united front against North Korea, and the communist dictatorship has reacted to the American President's visit with condemnation.
