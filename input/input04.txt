India's general election, the largest democratic exercise in history, begins Monday. Voters will elect 543 members to the lower house of parliament, which will then select the country's next prime minister. More than 814 million voters ---- eligible to cast ballots over the next month to elect the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha, up from 713 million voters in 2009. The Indian voting pool ---- larger than the total populations of the United States and Western Europe combined. Given the infrastructure in India, an election of this scale can't ---- done in a day. Voting will take place in nine blocks over the next five weeks, to allow election authorities to tackle the daunting logistics of operating 930,000 polling stations. The vote counting will ---- carried out and concluded on May 16.  India's flagging economic performance ---- the election's central issue. After registering Chinese-style growth rates of 8% to 10% in the 2000s, India's economy slowed sharply in 2012. GDP growth now remains below 5%, coupled with persistently high inflation. Indian politicians and academics remain divided over whether the country should focus its energy on first reigniting growth or on alleviating poverty. Even after a decade of rapid growth, India ---- still home to one in three of the world's poorest people. Unlike other countries, India's poor tend to vote in higher numbers than the rich.
